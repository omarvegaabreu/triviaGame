# triviaGame

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.\* A trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options.

#Rules of play

- The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

- The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

- The player pick more than one answer per question.

- Please pay attention to the counter.

# JavaScript Assignment 2

Please excuse if this readme is a little verbose, however I is an excersie to continue to learn MVC.

1. Inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`, is where all the HTML mark up is laid out.

2. The folder `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

   - In the `css` folder, the `style.css` contains the css code.
   - In the `javascript` folder, the `app.js` file; contains all the JavaScript and jQuery code.
   - In the `images` folder, all the images are saved.
